# DudeHook

### i made this because i was kinda bored. ofc the hack should work on every Dude simulator because the whole series has same code only number changed in name

## How to use waypoints
1. Inject cheat
2. Open tab "Waypoints"
3. Go to any place you want to save
4. Type in text area name of waypoint
5. click "Create Waypoint Here"

## How to use Custom Waypoints list
in this tutorial i will use my own list which
you can download from this repo and it will be in folder
"Waypoints-cfg", remember this is for Dude Simulator 2 
and it will work only in DS 2 
1. Download Waypoints.dh
2. Replace it in C:\DudeHook\ with current file(Warning! it will overwrite your waypoints)
3. Done, if you have injected Cheat already it will refresh automatically

## Update Log
